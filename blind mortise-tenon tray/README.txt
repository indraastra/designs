The usual finger tenon joints have a distinctively CNC'd look due to the need
to overcut any sharp internal corners. I got tired of that look, so instead, 
this tray uses secret finger tenon joints from this collection:

The joints are in fact hidden by a thin layer of material left uncut, but the
slight cost is that the endgrain of this layer is visible at every outside 
corner of the tray. See closeup picture for more detail.
